<h2>3. Read about: if...else</h2>
  
    The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement in the 
    optional else clause will be executed.
`Syntax`
```javascript
if (condition)
  statement1

// With an else clause
if (condition)
  statement1
else
  statement2
```

`condition`
    
    An expression that is considered to be either truthy or falsy.

`statement1`

    Statement that is executed if condition is truthy. Can be any statement, including further nested if statements. To execute 
    multiple statements, use a block statement ({ /* ... */ }) to group those statements. To execute no 
    statements, use an empty statement.

`statement2`

    Statement that is executed if condition is falsy and the else clause exists. Can be any statement, including block statements and 
    further nested if statements.

`Description`

    Multiple if...else statements can be nested to create an else if clause. Note that there is no elseif (in one word) keyword in 
    JavaScript.
```javascript
if (condition1)
  statement1
else if (condition2)
  statement2
else if (condition3)
  statement3
// â€¦
else
  statementN
  ```
`Examples`
```javascript
if (cipher_char === from_char) {
  result = result + to_char;
  x++;
} else {
  result = result + clear_char;
}
```
```javascript
if (x > 50) {
  /* do something */
} else if (x > 5) {
  /* do something */
} else {
  /* do something */
}
```

<h2>4. Read about: for</h2>

    The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, 
    followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.
`Syntax`
```javascript
    for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])
  statement
``` 
`initialization`
  
    An expression (including assignment expressions) or variable declaration evaluated once before the loop begins. Typically used to 
    initialize a counter variable. This expression may optionally declare new variables with var or let keywords. Variables declared 
    with var are not local to the loop, i.e. they are in the same scope the for loop is in. Variables declared with let are local 
    to the statement. The result of this expression is discarded.

`condition`

    An expression to be evaluated before each loop iteration. If this expression evaluates to true, statement is executed. If the 
    expression evaluates to false, execution exits the loop and goes to the first statement after the for construct.This conditional
    test is optional. If omitted, the condition always evaluates to true.

`final-expression`

    An expression to be evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. This occurs before the next evaluation of condition. 
    Generally used to update or increment the counter variable.

`statement`

    A statement that is executed as long as the condition evaluates to true. To execute multiple statements within the loop, 
    use a block statement ({ /* ... */ }) to group those statements. To execute no statement within the loop, use an empty
    statement (;).
    
`Example`
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  // more statements
}
```
