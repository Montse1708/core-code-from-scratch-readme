<h2>2. Bad Code exercise</h2>

`Bad code`
```javascript
var cond = false;

if ((cond = true)) {
  console.log('The cond variable is true');
} else {
  console.log('The cond variable is false');
}
```

`Fix code`
```javascript
var cond = false;

if (cond == true) {
  console.log('The cond variable is true');
} else {
  console.log('The cond variable is false');
}
```  

<h4>Answer: </h4>

    At the beginning of the code, the variable has the value of false as its assignment, however, when running the code without 
    correcting it appears true, because at  the moment of putting the if it only has an equal before true. By only having a "=" 
    a new value is being assigned to the variable, in this case true, that is why when running it appears true.
    To correct this error, you just have to add another equal to the if condition, so you are told that if the variable is true, 
    print true, otherwise print false. Finally, the parentheses of the if condition are removed.

<h2>3. Bad Code 2 exercise</h2>

`Bad code`
```javascript
var n = 100;

if (n == 100) {
  console.log('This is a special number!');
}
if (n < 1000) {
  console.log('');
} else {
  console.log('Just a regular number');
}
if (n % 10 == 0) {
  console.log('This number is multiple of 10');
}
```

`Fix code`
```javascript
var n = 100;

if (n == 100) {
  console.log('This is a special number!');
} else if (n < 1000 && n % 10 == 0) {
  console.log('This number is almost special');
} else {
  console.log('Just a regular number');
}
```
<h4>Answer: </h4>

    When you have several conditions, it is correct to use else if. The first condition is put with if while the other conditions must 
    be put with else if and the last condition with else. In addition to the fact that if you want to put different conditions in a 
    single condition, the operand "&&" or "||" is used, depending on the case. In this code "&&" was used because you had to put "and" 
    in order for all the conditions to be met at the same time.
