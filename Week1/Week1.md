<h2> 1. Create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages</h2>

<h3>- Interpreted Programming Languages</h3>
Is the code that is ejecute line for line and it doesn't need compile with a compilator. The computer is able to reed and ejecute the instructions. But for undestand the instruction, the computer needs a parser. The parser reads the instruccions line for line and the ejecute it, so this process is late. The interpreted Programming Languages is very tardy. Examples: JavaScript, Phyton, Ruby.

<h3>- Compiled Programming Languages</h3>
Is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code) and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no translation is performed on pre-execution). Converts code to binaries that are read by the operating system. Examples: C C#, GO.
